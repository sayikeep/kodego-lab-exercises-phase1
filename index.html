    <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Louise Adeline Tancinco-Carbonell. 
            <b>An English studies major who landed a banking career</b>. I love to spend late night drives with husband and my kids. I used to fan over sci-fi and thriller novels, but has long shifted to reading financial and business related books.<b>I have always been a language-learning geek. I know a little Japanese and Korean. Now, I am focused in developing my Spanish and my Polish language knowledge as well.</b>  I aim to develop my own language learning app or website after this course with Kodego.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am perceptive, compassionate in some sense, resilient, headstrong as my husband would say. My greatest weakness is that: <b>Ako po ang nahihiyang maningil sa mga nangutang sa akin</b>
